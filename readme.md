# new neovim config

I've used the same config for awhile, and it has a *LOT* of stuff I don't like
in it. I want to focus on minimalism and speed.

Plugins I use: 
**note: I will be using neovims built in LSP features for added simplicity**
- colorscheme (muon, desert-warm-256)
- transparency
- leap
- trouble
- telescope w/ ripgrep
- ? a file explorer ? (actually just use ranger)
